Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can estimate an employee's annual salary. The process involves:

Data Loading and Exploration: Understanding the structure and characteristics of the employee data.

Data Cleaning: Checking for missing values and duplicates.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing key relationships and distributions within the dataset (e.g., gender distribution, job rates, average salaries by department/country, overtime hours).

Model Training: Building a Linear Regression model using "Years" and "Job Rate" as features to predict "Annual Salary".

Model Saving: Persisting the trained model for later use.

Streamlit Application: Creating a simple web interface where users can input "Years" and "Job Rate" to get a real-time salary prediction.

Features
Data Analysis: Comprehensive analysis of employee data.

Data Visualization: Interactive plots to understand data trends.

Linear Regression Model: A predictive model for salary estimation.

Streamlit Web App: An intuitive interface for making salary predictions.

Model Persistence: The trained model is saved for easy deployment.

Files in the Repository
prediction.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook contains the entire data science workflow, including:

Loading the Employees.xlsx dataset.

Performing initial data inspection (head, tail, info, shape, isna, duplicated).

Generating various visualizations (pie chart for gender, histograms for job rate and overtime hours, bar charts for average salary by department and job rates by country).

Splitting data into training and testing sets.

Training a LinearRegression model.

Evaluating the model using Mean Absolute Error.

Saving the trained model as linearmodel.pkl using joblib.

my_app.py: This Python script is a Streamlit application that:

Provides a user interface for inputting "Years" and "Job Rate".

Loads the pre-trained linearmodel.pkl.

Predicts the annual salary based on the user's input.

Displays the predicted salary in a user-friendly format.

Employees.xlsx: The dataset used for training and evaluating the model. It contains various employee attributes, including "Years", "Job Rate", and "Annual Salary".

linearmodel.pkl: This file is the serialized (saved) Linear Regression model. It is generated by prediction.ipynb and loaded by my_app.py for making predictions without retraining the model every time.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is Employees.xlsx. This Excel file contains information about employees, including features relevant to salary prediction.

The original dataset can be found on Kaggle:
Company Employees Dataset



Usage
Running the Jupyter Notebook (prediction.ipynb)
Start Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

Open prediction.ipynb: Navigate to the file in the Jupyter interface and open it.

Run all cells: Execute all cells in the notebook sequentially to perform data analysis, model training, and save the linearmodel.pkl file.

Running the Streamlit Application (my_app.py)
Ensure linearmodel.pkl exists: Make sure you have run prediction.ipynb at least once to generate the linearmodel.pkl file in the same directory as my_app.py.

Run the Streamlit app:

streamlit run my_app.py

Access the app: A new tab will open in your web browser, displaying the Salary Prediction App. You can input "Years" and "Job Rate" and click the "Press the button for salary prediction" button to see the estimated salary.

Model Details
The project utilizes a Linear Regression model from scikit-learn.

Input Features (X):

Years: Likely representing years of experience or tenure.

Job Rate: A numerical rating or scale related to job performance or complexity.

Target Variable (y):

Annual Salary: The salary to be predicted.

The model is trained to find a linear relationship between these input features and the annual salary, allowing for predictions on new, unseen data.

Technologies Used
Python

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib: For data visualization.

Scikit-learn: For machine learning model (Linear Regression).

Joblib: For saving and loading the machine learning model.

Streamlit: For building the interactive web application.

NumPy: For numerical operations, especially array handling for model input.
